# Pixela Habit Tracker

This project implements a program that runs in the terminal an can be used to create a new user and manage an user's graph(s) in Pixela.

**Practice goals:** 
- handle Post, Put and Delete HTTP requests
- authentication using HTTP Headers


## Key difference from course solution

This project was implemented as part of the day 37 of the course 100 days of Python. All implementation of features covered in the course was taken care of prior to watch the solution videos. 

In the course lessons, no program was implemented per se. Only each request was made separately just to demonstrate how Post, Put and Delete HTTP requests work, and how to authenticate using HTTP headers. This is what the code in the main.py file implements.

I used the knowlege aquired in this day's lesson to implemente a program that runs in the terminal an can be used to create a new user and manage an user's graph(s) in Pixela. This is what the code in the challenge.py file implements.
## How it works

- Use the terminal to execute the script in challenge.py
- Follow the instructions in the screen to select an action.
- Actions available:
  - Create new user in Pixela
  - Create new graph for existing user in Pixela
  - Create new pixel in exisiting user's graph in Pixela
  - Update existing pixel in a user's graph in Pixela
  - Delete an existing new pixel in a user's graph in Pixela
- In order to get more details about how to fill the inputs, visit the Pixela's documentation at https://docs.pixe.la/
