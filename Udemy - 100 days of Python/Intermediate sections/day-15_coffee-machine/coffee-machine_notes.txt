This coffee machine project was implemented as part of the day 15 of the course

-> CODE FILES

The machine_config file contains:

- a menu dictionary, with the drinks that the machine can make.
Each drink entry contain a nested dictionary of ingredients, with the names of each ingredient and respective quantities that are used to make that drink.
Each drink also has a cost related.

- a resources dictionary, with the ingredients that the machine has on start.
Each ingredient entry contains a nested dictionary listing that ingredient's unit of measurement, quantity, and minimum amount.

The code in the main file was written to refer to the machine_config file to get data for menu and resources. Any changes to the machine_config will reflect on the program execution, such as changes in quantities, and addition/removal of menu items and/or resources.

-> HOW THE COFFEE MACHINE WORKS

1 . When the machine starts:
- the resources are at their fullest at the first use, and they are consumed at each drink that is made while the machine is on.
- the amount of profit in the machine starts at zero.

2. Turning the machine off replenishes all resources and collects the profits.

3. If any of the resources goes below its minimum while the machine is on, an alert is displayed in the screen listing all the resources that are low and the respective current quantity.

3. A list of the drinks from the machine_config menu that can be made with the current amount of available resources is displayed in the screen, and user is prompted to choose a drink.
If there are not enough resources to make any drink, a notification is displayed and the user is prompted to turn the machine off, so the resources can be replenished.

4. The user can type the name of the drink that they want. 
- If an invalid option is typed, the user is prompted with a notification and can press enter to restart.
- If a valid option is entered, the cost for the drink will be displayed, and the user will be prompted to type how many of each coin (quarter, dime, nickle and penny) they are inserting.

5. If user adds enough coins to make up for the drink's cost:
- The drink will be made, deducting the amount of ingredients from the resources.
- The cost of the drink will be added to the machine profits.
- A message with the amount of change will be displayed, if there's any.
- A message notifying the user that the drink is ready will be displayed.
- User will be prompted to press enter to return to the main menu.

6. If coins added are not enough to pay for the drink, the user will be prompted with the amount due and the option to add more coins or cancel the order.
- If order is cancelled, the money is refunded (message is displayed) and player is prompted to press enter to go back to the main menu.
- If user wants to add more coins, the user will be again prompted to type how many of each coin (quarter, dime, nickle and penny) they are inserting.
- This loop repeats until either the user insert enough coins to pay for the drink, which triggers item 5, or the user cancels the order.

7. The machine has two admin commands that can be typed instead of a drink choice:
- 'report': prints a report that lists the current quantity of each resource, and the current amount of profit that the machine has made.
- 'off': turns the machine off.

-> DIFFERENCES FROM IMPLEMENTATION DISPLAYED IN THE COURSE

- Show menu: the implementation displayed in the course has a hard coded menu (espresso, latte, cappuccino). Only after the user selects an item and there's no sufficient resources to make that drink, it displays a message saying that the drink cannot be made due to the lack of resources. This implementation has a dinamic menu that consumes data from the machine_config file, and displays only the items that can be made with the current amount of resources available.

- Receive money: the implementation displayed in the course receives the amount of each coin only one. If user doesn't add enough coins in one try, the order is automatically cancelled and the money is refunded. This implementation allows the user to add more coins until the cost is covered, or the user has the option to cancel and get the refund.

- Low resources alert: this was added to the scope exclusivelly in this implementation.

- Clear screen at the end of an action, when user presses enter to go back to main menu: this was added to the scope exclusivelly in this implementation.
