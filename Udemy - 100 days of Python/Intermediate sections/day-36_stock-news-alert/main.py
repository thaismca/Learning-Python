# endpoints
STOCK_ENDPOINT = "http://api.marketstack.com/v1/eod"

# company data
STOCK_SYMBOL = "TSLA"
COMPANY_NAME = "Tesla Inc"

# dates
yesterday = (datetime.now() - timedelta(1)).date()
day_before_yesterday = (datetime.now() - timedelta(2)).date()

## STEP 1: Use http://api.marketstack.com/v1/eod
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

# fetch API data
params_stock = {
    "symbols": STOCK_SYMBOL,
    "access_key": os.environ["STOCKS_API_KEY"],
    'date_from': day_before_yesterday,
    'date_to': yesterday
}
res = requests.get(STOCK_ENDPOINT, params=params_stock)
res.raise_for_status()
stock_data = res.json()["data"]

# get closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday
yesterday_close = stock_data[0]["close"]
day_before_close = stock_data[1]["close"]

# check if the difference between yesterday and the day before yesterday is greater that 5%
if abs(yesterday_close - day_before_close) > abs(day_before_close * 0.05):
    print("get news")






## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 



## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 



#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
